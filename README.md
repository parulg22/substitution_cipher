A key is defined as a string of 26 lowercase letters. The user is asked to provide a key along with a file that they want to be encrypted or decrypted. 
The program will create and return a new file that has the contents encrypted or decrypted. If a key is not provided, the user can allow the program
to randomly generate a key that fits the requirements.
